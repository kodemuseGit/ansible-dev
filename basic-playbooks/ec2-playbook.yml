# This playbook is an example for deploying multiple instances into

# EC2/Euca and "doing something" with them.

#

# - uses the ec2 and ec2_vol module.

#

# Run this with ansible-playbook and supply the private key for your

# EC2/Euca user (to access the instance in the second play), e.g:

#

# ansible-playbook eucalyptus-ec2-deploy.yml -v --private-key=/path/to/ec2/pri/key

#



# The play operates on the local (Ansible control) machine.

- name: Stage instance(s)

  hosts: local

  # Launch 5 instances with the following parameters.  Register the output.
